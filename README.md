# Energyefficient WebRTC Asterisk systems

Mapping the energy difference between a mesh and a SFU video mode setup


## Tools Used for the work

1.Webrtc client  : For the Webrtc SIP user agent to communicate with the SIP and media Server ( asterisk) I configured cyber_mega_phone_2k [1].  
2 . Compute Pressure API  : For the experiments to record the CPU load and energy efficiency of the RTP topologies namely meshed, mixed and single forwarding I have used the Compute Pressure API[12.
3. Docker image for asterisk setup on docker engine [3]
4. PJSIP-pjproject in Asterisk
